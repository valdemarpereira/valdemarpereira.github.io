        Contract position in the Digital Marketing team to support and build new tools with the purpose of acquiring and retain online gambling users.

        My main role responsibilities were mostly decoupling an existing monolith application (Campaign System) into microservices and working in greenfield projects to support new marketing campaigns:

        - Proposing, documenting and implementing architectural solutions as part of breaking a monolith into microservices and adding new features using a microservices architecture.
        - Working closely with the architectures while identifying potential solutions for new business requests. All proposed architecture designs follow the C4 model, Domain-Driven Design
          and a Hexagonal architecture (Port and Adaptors). All these proposals were successful signed off and translated into code.
          This allows us to build loose coupling, high cohesion and highly scalable microservices.
        - Mentoring, coaching and supporting team members. Advising the team on new tools and frameworks. A few examples of proposal tools such as Spring State Machine, Lombok vs AutoValue or AssertJ.

        Projects:

        - <b>Campaign Scheduler</b>

          Microservice created during the breakdown of Campaign System to create a more robust and scalable approach to schedule the Start and End dates of recurrent campaigns.
          This is a Message-Driven microservice.

        - <b>Campaign Orchestrator</b>

          Orchestrator between several microservices involved during the send out of  marketing campaigns. Based on internal rules, it can decided the flow of a campaign send out.

        - <b>Operation Monitor Report</b>

          Microservice used to gather reports of the health and status of a marketing campaign. It gathers data from several communication channels, errors, budget limits, etc,
          and based on business rules it can decide if a campaign must be suspended or stop. It's also used to send warnings and reports on the current status of active campaigns.
