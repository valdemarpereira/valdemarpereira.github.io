        After previously working for Kindred, I was offered a contract position in the Digital Marketing team to support and build new tools used to help acquire and retain online gambling users.
        The role was mostly decoupling a monolith application called Campaign System into microservices and work in new greenfield projects.

        - Proposing, documenting and implementing architectural solutions as part of breaking a monolith into microservices and adding new features using a microservices architecture.
        - Working closely with the architectures while identifying potential solutions for new business requests. All proposed architecture designs follow the C4 model, Domain-Driven Design
          and a Hexagonal architecture (Port and Adaptors). All these proposals were successful signed off and translated into code. This allows us to build loose coupling, high cohesion and highly scalable microservices.
